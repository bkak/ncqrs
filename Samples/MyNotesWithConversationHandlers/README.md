MY NOTES Conversation Handlers
===========================

This is a demonstration of multiple AR communication.
ConversationHandlers are created just like EventHandlers, they also subscribe to the Event raised by Domain.
Then in Conversation Handler we can write code that we need to converse between 2 AR's.
It simply demonstrates it by creating a Summary AR for notes.
But can be used to Create or Update follow-up AR's.
